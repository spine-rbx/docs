# Installing

At the moment, there are two ways to install Spine.
The first is by including `Spine` as a git submodule,
and the second is by using wally. The former is currently
recommended, as wally doesn't expose types, and that is
needed to correct type hints. 

Spine will work just as well under wally, and as soon
as this is no longer an issue it will be the *only* way
to install Spine.
