# Overview

With Spine's OOP Implementation, there are many objects that extend other objects.
These will always have a link to the parent object, and a list of what it inherits.
This list will contain everything it inherits, and where it is inherited from.

This documentation doesn't contain information about when to use certain modules,
or implementation details. To find all this, I suggest you read the [topics](/guide/topics/)
section of the guide.
